          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 leading-loose">
            Hello! I am Sergio SÃ¡nchez, a Full Stack Developer from Argentina
            currently working remotely in Mexico. I have a diverse professional
            background with experience in sales, administration, and purchasing
            in Denmark and Germany. Recently, I completed a Java course and am
            expanding my skillset with Java.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 leading-loose">
            I am passionate about creating web applications that provide real
            value to users. My Wallet is one such project where I have poured my
            efforts to build a comprehensive financial management tool. I will
            be traveling to New Zealand with a Working Holiday Visa to find a
            job as a web developer. I am excited about the new opportunities and
            challenges that lie ahead.
          </p>
