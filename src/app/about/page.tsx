          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5 mb-3">About the Developer</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300/80 leading-loose">
            Hello! I am Sergio SÃ¡nchez, a Full Stack Developer from Argentina
            currently working remotely in Mexico. I have a diverse professional
            background with experience in sales, administration, and purchasing
            in Denmark and Germany. Recently, I completed a Java course and am
            expanding my skillset with Java and Springboot.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300/80 leading-loose">
            I am passionate about creating web applications that provide real
            value to users. My Wallet is one such project where I have poured my
            efforts to build a comprehensive financial management tool. In
            September, I will be traveling to New Zealand with a Working Holiday
            Visa to find a job as a web developer. I am excited about the new
            opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.
          </p>
